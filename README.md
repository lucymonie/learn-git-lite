# Git for non-technical members of a tech team

If you're a member of a tech team but your function is non-technical, it is useful to know how to use git and Github as this is a key tool for technical team members. Having git installed on your machine and being able to pull down code and run it locally will likely come in useful.

## What is git?
Git is a version control system. Version control systems are software that help you track changes you make in your code over time. As you change your code, you instruct the version control system to take a snapshot of your files (these are called commits). The version control system saves that snapshot permanently so you can recall it later if you need it.

Without version control, you may be tempted to keep multiple copies of your code. Itâ€™s easy to change or delete the wrong file, potentially losing work. Version control systems manage all versions of your code but present you with a single version at a time (usually the latest).

## Your OS
